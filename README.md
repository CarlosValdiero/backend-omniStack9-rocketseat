# Back-End OmniStack 9 - Rocketseat

This project was developed at rocketseat's OmniStack 9 week. The aim of this project is to develop a platform for programming companies to make their spaces available for developers to obtain new experiences. So they can get to know each other and exchange experiences.

[Front-End Web](https://github.com/CarlosValdiero/frontend-web-omniStack9-rocketseat) - Front-end project using ReactJS

[Front-End Mobile](https://github.com/CarlosValdiero/frontend-mobile-omniStack9-rocketseat) - Front-end project using React Native

The motivation to develop this project was to learn about NodeJS with Express.

### Tech

 - NodeJS
 - Express
 - Mongoose
 - Socket io 


### System idea

 - In this system, the company informs which technologies it works with, and for what value it makes its space available.
 - The developer requests the visit for a date.
 - The company accepts or rejects the order. 

### Installation

Clone the repository with:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CarlosValdiero/backend-omniStack9-rocketseat.git
```
Install all dependencies:
```
$ yarn install or npm install
```
Now it is necessary to put the database URL in a .env file, in my case, I used [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas):
```
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING = <url>
```
